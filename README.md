# CS50W Project 2: Flack
Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is an online messaging service using Flask, JavaScript and Socket.IO similar in spirit to [Slack.](https://slack.com) Built the web UI with Javascript running code server-side and Socket.IO communicating between clients and servers.

Users will be able to sign in with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time.
